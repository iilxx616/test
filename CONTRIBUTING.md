# Contributing to test
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `MAIN`.
2. If you've added code, please test it.
3. Make sure your code works.
4. Issue that pull request! (develop branch)
